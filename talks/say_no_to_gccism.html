int main(int argc, const char *argv[]) {
  int foo(int x) {
    int bar(int y) {
      int baz(int z) {
        int qux(int x) {

  return foo(argc);
}
        </code></pre>
        
      </section>

      <section data-markdown>
        > __Don't do that!__

        - Avoid GCC extensions (nested functions, etc.)
        - Test with multiple compilers
        - `-std=c99` as a compiler argument for C for example

      ## Compiler (infrastucture) was born!

      <section data-markdown>
        - Started as a research project in ~2000 by Chris Lattner and Vikram Adve
        - Was released under NCSA (a BSD-style license)
        - Lattner was hired by Apple in 2005 to work on LLVM for uses in its products
        - Apparently Apple doesn't like GPL
        - LLVM/Clang is now widely used in Apple's development systems/tools
        - FreeBSD also switched to Clang as the default compiler
        - Modern, well-maintained codebase
      </section>
    </section>

    <section>
      <section data-markdown>
        ## So what's it about?

        - Provides the LLVM IR and an infrastructure to write a compiler
        - Implemented as a set of tools and API to work with the IR
        - Plugin architecture
        - A backend for each target machine
        - A frontend for each language
      </section>

      <section data-markdown>
        ## IR

        - Provides generic types support
        - Machine-independant instructions
        - SSA form
        - Allows for various metadata to be added to it to help the optimizers
      </section>

      <section data-markdown>
        ## IR Example

        ```c
        int foo(int a, int b, int c) {
          int r;
          if ((c & a ? 0 : 1) | (c & b ? 1 : 0))
            r = a | b | c;
          else
            r = 0;

          return r;
        }
        ```

        Translates to:

        ```llvm
        ; Function Attrs: nounwind readnone uwtable
        define i32 @foo(i32 %a, i32 %b, i32 %c) #0 {
          %1 = and i32 %c, %a
          %not. = icmp eq i32 %1, 0
          %2 = zext i1 %not. to i32
          %3 = and i32 %c, %b
          %4 = icmp ne i32 %3, 0
          %5 = zext i1 %4 to i32
          %6 = or i32 %2, %5
          %7 = icmp eq i32 %6, 0
          br i1 %7, label %11, label %8

        ; &lt;label&gt;:8     ; preds = %0
          %9 = or i32 %b, %a
          %10 = or i32 %9, %c
          br label %11

        ; &lt;label&gt;:11    ; preds = %0, %8
          %r.0 = phi i32 [ %10, %8 ], [ 0, %0 ]
          ret i32 %r.0
        }
        ```
      </section>

      <section data-markdown>
        ## DAG

        - Directed-Acyclic-Graph representing the SSA form of the IR
        - Nodes represent values/operations
        - Directed edges represent use of a value.
        - Goes through various _legalization_ passes
        - A pass produces a (potentially modified) DAG on which the next pass can
          be applied
        - Finally produces a linear representation of all the machine operations
          and/or values to be produced

      </section>

      <section data-markdown>
        ## Plugins
        - Any number of _plugins_ can be added to the basic LLVM
        - Clang is a plugin which works as a C/C++/Obj-C frontend
        - Dragonegg is another example (it works as a backend and optimizer
          for GCC)
        - LLDB is a debugger which uses Clang and LLVM APIs so it always has
          access to backends and frontends in Clang/LLVM
        - Also allows JIT'ing code while debugging

        ### Optimizations
        - Optimizer only needs to know how to optimize the LLVM IR
        - Implemented as a series of passes
        - Passes can be added from plugins
        - The metadata is preserved for other passes to use
      </section>

      <h2>My contributions to LLVM</h2>

      <section data-markdown>
        ### IR
        - Added a few optimizations to the IR
        - Examples:
        ```
        (or (bool? A : B) (bool? C : D)) -> (bool? (or A C) (or C D))
        ```
        ```
        (and (sext bool to A), B) -> (select bool, B, 0)
        (and ~(sext bool to A), B) -> (select bool, 0, B)
        ```
        ```
        (sub 0, (zext bool to A)) -> (sext bool to A)
        (sub 0, (sext bool to A)) -> (zext bool to A)
        ```
        - Worked on the vectorizer (vector dependencies etc.)
        - Worked on adding support for Intel MPX (Memory Protection Extensions)
      </section>

      <section data-markdown>
        ### X86 Backend
        - Added a few optimizations (mainly to Intel AVX/AVX2 instruction
          extensions)
           - AVX* is Advanced Vector Extensions
           - Allows wide parallel registers/instructions
        - Examples:
            - For sign-extending vectors:
        ```
        vpmovxzbd/wd + shift-left + shift-right -> vpmovsxbd/wd
        ```
        - Worked on adding support for Intel MPX
        - Worked on adding support for Haswell architecture's instruction set

      <h2>Why even bother?</h2>

      <section data-markdown>
        > GCC already does the job!
      </section>

      <section data-markdown>
        ### License
        
        - The BSD-style license used by LLVM has fewer restrictions
        - Much easier to include it as part of commercial software
      </section>

      <section data-markdown>
        ### Modern Design
        
        - The codebase is very modular as it as designed to be so from the beginning
        - As a result, cleaner code
        - Simpler to extend and modify - the learning curve to start contributing
          patches is very short
        - I was able to make commits in the first week or so at Intel co-op
        - Extensive unit tests which are easily runnable (`make test`)
      </section>

      <section data-markdown>
        ### Extensibility
        
        - The modular design allows for easy use of plugins
        - JIT'ing is easy thanks to the LLVM IR
        - Examples:
            - The OpenGL pipline on MacOS provides both GPU and CPU rendering by leaving graphics code in LLVM IR
            - During runtime, if an instruction can be run on GPU, it is passed to the GPU
            - If the GPU doesn't support a feature, the same code can be run through shims on the CPU
            - `llvmpipe` is another example
      </section>

      <section data-markdown>
        ### Performance

        - Compile-time performance for Clang is dramatically better than GCC
            - Chromium, ImageMagick, PHP, compile much faster
        - Produces smaller binaries than GCC
            - QT, Chromium are examples
        - Performance is on par with GCC
            - Phoronix has a benchmarked the two compilers
            - Clang is lacking OpenMP support
      </section>

      <section data-markdown>
        ### Diagnostics

        - Clang produces much smarter diagnostics
            - Can even do color highlighting on the diagnostic prints
            - Better preservation of metadata plays a role in these better diagnostics
        - GCC catching up (with colors in 4.9)

        ### _Side project_
        Trying to get yocto project to build using Clang instead of GCC!
        </p>
      </section>

      <section data-markdown>
        ### Objectives
        1. Get Clang to be built by bitbake
        2. Allow for simple configuration to switch toolchains
        3. Get poky-tiny core-image-minimal to be built by Clang
      </section>

      <section data-markdown>
        ### Progress
        1. Building Clang as a bitbake package was easy - based on llvm3.3 recipe
           from meta-oe
        2. Mark Hatle's work on
           [Adding a secondary toolchain](http://openembedded.org/wiki/Adding_a_secondary_toolchain)
           made this easy to achieve.
            - Simple task of setting the right `TOOLCHAIN` variables
            - [meta-tc-llvm](https://github.com/mtahmed/meta-tc-llvm): A secondary
              llvm toolchain layer that can be used to enable the secondary toolchain
        3. Mainly getting failing packages to compile using Clang/LLVM with additional
           set of patches
            - Most of the failures are because of GCC extensions that are unsupported
              in Clang
            - Busybox is also failing to compile correctly (and causing runtime errors and
              probably kernel crashes as well)
      </section>

      <section data-markdown>
        ### More progress!
        - In total, 115 packages need to be built for `core-image-minimal` + `linux-yocto-tiny`
        - 103 of them are building fine with clang
        - 12 of them need to be built using gcc (these include the linux kernel, gcc,
           eglibc, elfutils etc.)
      </section>

      <section data-markdown>
        ### TODO
        1. Get the linux kernel to compile using Clang
            - LLVMLinux project aims to compile the linux kernel using Clang
            - A set of patches from LLVMLinux project should hopefully help us
              compile the kernel
        2. Investigate fixing failing packages
        3. Investigate busybox failures
